### Hello there, Welcome to my Github :wave:

I'm **Ryan** :man_technologist:, an aspiring Frontend Developer who can do a little bit of this and a little bit of that but can still get the job done. I'm currently working as a Graphics Designer and Web Developer. I would love to do frontend development projects and open to learning new technologies.
